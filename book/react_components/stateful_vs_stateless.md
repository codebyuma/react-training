# Stateful vs Stateless Components

### Stateful

- When you need internal state
	- D3 graph
- When you need to utilize a Component Lifecycle hook
	- Ajax request on mount
  - Setup animations
  - Access the raw DOM node for a 3rd party library

### Stateless
95% of the time all you need is a stateless component.
