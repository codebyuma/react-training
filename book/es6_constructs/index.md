# ES6

JavaScript was written by Brendan Eich during a ten day stretch in the nineteen ninties. More than twenty years later, the language is thriving. There are subsets, supersets, current versions, and an upcoming version. ES6 is that upcoming version, and it brings a lot of new features.
Some of the highlights:

- Classes
- Default Params
- Template Literals
- Destructuring
- Arrow Functions
- Promises
- let and const
- Modules
