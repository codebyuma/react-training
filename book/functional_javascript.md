# Functional JavaScript

![](../images/functional.jpg)

> Functional programming approaches computer programs as consisting of data transformations, much like functions in math. Your program is a collection of functions. Each function takes some inputs and produces some outputs. Simple functions are used as building blocks for more complex ones. This is one of the earliest approaches to programming, dating back to the 1960s and based on math developed in the 1930s.

The functional style is more flexible, and makes testing and debugging easier.

React is essentially brings these functional programming concepts to UI. It provides abstractions such as components which are (mostly) pure functions. Given some state (as props) they return some DOM. This allows us to get away from imperatively touching the DOM.
